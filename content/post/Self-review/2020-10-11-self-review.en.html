<h2>Introducing my Shiny App</h2>
<p>The purpose of my app is to enable users to develop insights on the state of Coronavirus in Australia through comparing data between chosen states over time.</p>
<p>My app is broken up into tabs to enhance its usability. There is an ‘About’ tab, a ‘How’ tab and an example tab detailing how I drew insights on Coronavirus using the app. This hopes to give the user a clear understanding on how to use the app, irrespective of their technological competence/capacity.</p>
<p>The ‘output’ tabs each contain a visualisation. The first has a map, the second has a line plot and the third has a comparison table.</p>
<p>To use the map, the user must input the states that they want to compare. It will generate a circle, and the size of the circle is dependent on the number of confirmed cases in that state to date. The user can click on the circle and it will give the exact number of confirmed cases in that state or territory. In the example below, I have chosen New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p><img src="/post/Self-review/map-nsw-vic.png" />
The user must choose a case type in addition to the previously selected states or territories to use the plot. Therefore the confirmed, recovered or daily death toll between chosen states or territories can be compared overtime. To produce the plot below I have chosen ‘confirmed’ as my case type. The plot can be ‘double-clicked’ to reveal a timeline of COVID-19 related events.</p>

Finally, to use the comparison table the user must select a date or dates to compare in addition to the previously selected states/territories and case type. This will generate a table which will allow them to compare daily case numbers and total case numbers for the chosen case type. dates and areas. I chose the earliest and most recent date to generate the comparison table below.</p>

<h2>Self Review</h2>
<div id="what-did-i-do-well" class="section level4">
<h4>What did I do well?</h4>
<p>The three aspects of the app that I did well were the user input and plotly event aspect of the app, as well as the explanation on how to use the app.</p>
<p>I did the explanation aspect of the app well because I provided an example of how I derived insights and arrived at conclusions using the app.</p>
<p>The plotly event that I created allows the user to ‘double-click’ on the plot to reveal a timeline of events, as mentioned above. I think I did this well because the user can easily compare and link the timeline events to points in the plot and draw conclusions on whether the restrictions were an effective measure in controlling the case numbers (as an example).</p>
<p>My use of the input data to generate outputs was well done because it meant the user has complete freedom in the outputs they want to generate as every output depends on the inputs they want to use.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-could-i-improve-on" class="section level4">
<h4>What could I improve on?</h4>
<p>My comparison table could definitely be improved. For example, when ‘death’ is input the table and values change, however, the column headings are the same. In this context, the headings don’t make sense as they are titled ‘number of new cases’ and ‘total number of cases’. it would make more sense if they changed according to input and were titled ‘number of new deaths’ and ‘total number of deaths’.</p>
<p>In addition, I coded the title of the plot so that it would change according to input. This means that if the user selects ‘confirmed’ the title would change to ‘The number of <strong>confirmed</strong> COVID-19 cases’, and so on. However, when ‘death’ is selected the title changes to ‘The number of <strong>death</strong> COVID-19 cases’. This doesn’t make grammatical sense, however, the <code>paste0</code> function did not have the capacity to change the whole title based on the selected case type. In hindsight, I should have used an <code>ifelse</code> statement to produce a better title.</p>

<h4>A plausible addition to my app</h4>
<p>I would like to update the map so that the circles change based on the case type chosen (as well as the states and/or territories chosen).</p>
<p>The main issue with this change is the map doesn’t delete circles if the input has been changed. For example, if I select New South Wales and Victoria, and then deselect Victoria, it won’t update the map. This means that if a case type is chosen and then changed, the map will layer the two case types which is problematic for comparison.</p>
<p>To overcome this problem, I have two approaches that I think would be feasible. The first would involve use the <code>ifelse</code> function and the second improving the use of the reactive function.</p>

<div id="an-implausible-addition-to-my-app" class="section level4">
<h4>An implausible addition to my app</h4>
<p>I would have liked to draw insights on the age-group breakdown of cases. However, the data didn’t have information on the ages of those infected. Having this data would have given the user an indication on the age of those spreading the virus and the age of those dying from this virus. This information would be pivotal in determining the age groups that need to be protected from the virus.</p>
