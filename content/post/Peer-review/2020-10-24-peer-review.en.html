<div id="summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I am reviewing a package written by Helen Evangelina titled “covid19shiny”.</p>
<p>The purpose of the package is to provide users with a shiny application which presents the state of COVID-19 worldwide.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-did-i-think-this-package-would-do" class="section level2">
<h2>What did I think this package would do?</h2>
<p>The covid19shiny package has three datasets; <code>covid19wrangled</code>, <code>covid19total</code>, <code>worldshp</code> and four functions; <code>launch_app</code>, <code>selectInput01</code>, <code>dailyplot</code> and <code>covidtable</code>. That considered, I thought the package would launch the application, provide a wrangled dataset for the application to use and simplify the user interface and server side of the shiny application.</p>
</div>
<div id="did-it-do-it" class="section level2">
<h2>Did it do it?</h2>
<p>I am going to break this question up into three subsections; the datatsets, the launch function,</p>

improvements that could be made to the shiny app inside the package? Is the documentation sucicient to get
started? (4 marks)</p>
