## Summary

I am reviewing a package written by Helen Evangelina titled "covid19shiny".

The purpose of the package is to provide users with a shiny application which presents the state of COVID-19 worldwide.

## What did I think this package would do?

The covid19shiny package has three datasets; `covid19wrangled`, `covid19total`, `worldshp` and four functions; `launch_app`, `selectInput01`, `dailyplot` and `covidtable`. That considered, I thought the package would launch the application, provide a wrangled dataset for the application to use and simplify the user interface and server side of the shiny application.
