## Data Description

The coronavirus data comprises of 7 variables and over 175,000 observations for a number of countries. The variables include; date, province, country, latitude, longitude, type of case (i.e. confirmed/recovered) and number of daily cases. 

The raw data has been collected on a daily basis since the 22nd of January 2020 by John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The sources for the raw data include; the World Health Organisation, the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local media reports, 1point3acres, Worldometers.info, BNO, DXY and other state and national government health departments.

The raw data has been tidied and collated into a package titled _coronavirus_, which has subsequently been used for this analysis. 

## An Explanation 

Coronavirus is the name given to a range of respiratory illnesses originating from the same family (Raoult et al., 2020). Each virus varies in its symptoms, with some strains being more fatal than others. Some of the viruses that belong to this family include; Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19. 

## A Comparison

Since appearing in Saudi Arabia in 2012, MERS has spread to 27 countries resulting in a total of 2494 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV worldwide. Saudi Arabia was home to approximately 2102 infections, and had 780 deaths, resulting in a death rate of `r percent(780/2102, accuracy = 0.01)` (World Health Organisation, 2020). 

```{r saudi-confirmed}
saudi_confirmed <- coronavirus %>%
  filter(country == "Saudi Arabia",
         type == "confirmed") %>%
  select(-country,
         -lat,
         -long,
         -type,
         -province) %>%
  summarise(average_new_cases = mean(cases),
            max_new_cases = max(cases),
            total = sum(cases)) 
```

```{r confirmed-table}
saudi_confirmed %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Average New Cases per day", "Maximum Number of New Cases per day", "Total Number of Cases"), 
        caption = "Summary Statistics for New COVID-19 Cases in Saudi Arabia") %>%
  kable_minimal()
```

```{r saudi-death}
saudi_death <- coronavirus %>%
  filter(country == "Saudi Arabia",
         type == "death") %>%
  select(-country,
         -lat,
         -long,
         -type,
         -province) %>%
  summarise(average_death_cases = mean(cases),
            max_death_cases = max(cases),
            total = sum(cases)) 
```

Since early 2020, there have been approximately `r saudi_confirmed$total` cases of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia and `r saudi_death$total`, thus resulting in a death rate of `r percent((saudi_death$total/saudi_confirmed$total), accuracy = 0.01)`. 

```{r death-table}
saudi_death %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Average Deaths per day", "Maximum Number of Deaths per day", "Total Number of Deaths"), 
        caption = "Summary Statistics for Deaths due to COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia") %>%
  kable_minimal()
```

```{r saudi-recovered}
saudi_recovered <- coronavirus %>%
  filter(country == "Saudi Arabia",
         type == "recovered") %>%
  select(-country,
         -lat,
         -long,
         -type,
         -province) %>%
  summarise(average_recovered_cases = mean(cases),
            max_recovered_cases = max(cases),
            total = sum(cases))
```

The maximum number of new cases on any given day was `r  saudi_confirmed$max_new_cases` cases, which is approximately `r percent(saudi_confirmed$max_new_cases/2102, accuracy = 0.01)` of the total number of MERS-CoV infections in Saudi Arabia over an 8-year period, emphasizing the magnitude of COVID-19. The average number of new infections per day is approximately `r round(saudi_confirmed$average_new_cases)` cases, whilst the average number of recovered cases per day is approximately `r round(saudi_recovered$average_recovered_cases)` cases. The maximum number of recovered cases on a given day was `r saudi_recovered$max_recovered_cases` cases. 

```{r recovered-table}
saudi_recovered %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Average Recovered Cases per day", "Maximum Number of Recovered Cases per day", "Total Number of Recovered Cases"), 
        caption = "Summary Statistics for Recovered COVID-19 Cases in Saudi Arabia") %>%
  kable_minimal()
```

Ultimately, the summary statistics and the interactive table suggest a clear difference in the prevalence of MERS-CoV and COVID-19. Although MERS-CoV is much more fatal with an alarmingly high death rate, COVID-19 is much more infectious. 

```{r interactive-table-saudi}
interactive_saudi <- DT::datatable(saudi,
              colnames = c("Date",
                           "Type of Case",
                           "Number of Cases"),
              caption = "Number of Confirmed or Recovered Coronavirus Cases on a given Date in Saudi Arabia", 
              options = list(pageLength = 8))
widgetframe::frameWidget(interactive_saudi)
```
