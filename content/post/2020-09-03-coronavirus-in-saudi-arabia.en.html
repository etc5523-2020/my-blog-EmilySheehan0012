<h2>An Explanation</h2>
<p>Coronavirus is the name given to a range of respiratory illnesses originating from the same family (Raoult et al., 2020). Each virus varys in its symptoms, with some strains being more fatal than others.Some of the viruses include; Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. This analysis hopes to provide insight and compare the infection rate of MERS-CoV and COVID-19.</p>
